Planalg
-------

This is a Mathematica package for working with planar algebras and
categories.

To use: either

- copy the Planalg directory to
$UserBaseDirectory/Applications

- or add the following line to your
$UserBaseDirectory/Kernel/init.m file:

PrependTo[$Path, "a director that contains Planalg, for instance this planalg git repository"]

Then, evaluate <<Planalg` in Mathematica to load the application.
